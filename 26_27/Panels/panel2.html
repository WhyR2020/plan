    From Excel spreadsheets to R scripts, data analysis is everywhere. However, its popularity results in many cases of serious misuse. Inflation bias (‘p-hacking’) and incorrect feature engineering (e.g., categorization of continuous variables) are among many potential traps that are often perceived as the proper way to analyze data. During Why R? 2020 (26.09.2020, 16:45-17:30 PM GMT+2) discussion panel Małgorzata Bogdan, Jaroslaw Harezlak, Frank Harrell and Olga Vitek will shed some light on common statistical mistakes. You can submit your questions using WhyR.pl/slack/ till 25.09.2020.
