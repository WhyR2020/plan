    Even before the establishment of Bioconductor, R has been a staple tool in bioinformatics. However, with the advent of NGS techniques, the speed and efficiency of computations become one of the most limiting factors of bioinformatics. Can R be reliably used when multi-omics studies are becoming more and more associated with big data? Michal Burdukiewicz, Leon Eyrich Jessen, Riinu Pius, Stefan Rödiger and Gordon Smyth will talk about the current state and future of bioinformatics in R during the Why R? discussion panel (26.09.2020, 12:00-12:45 PM CEST). You can submit your questions using WhyR.pl/slack/ till 25.09.2020.
